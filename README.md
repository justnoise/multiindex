_As of October 2015, this is a work in progress._

# MultiIndex
This is mostly an exercise to explore what a simple Python implementation of [Boost's MultiIndex Container](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html) might look like.

# Requirements
It uses [sortedcontainers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/index.html) for the sorted indexes.

# Todo
* Needs tests
